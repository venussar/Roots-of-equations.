# Roots ‚Äî Computational Methods Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of numerical analysis projects focused on **root-finding algorithms** and their applications to physics and mathematics problems.
Each exercise explores different iterative methods such as **Newton-Raphson**, **Halley‚Äôs Method**, **Secant Method**, **Fixed-Point Iteration**, and more.
The projects were developed using Python as part of the **Computational Methods** course.

### 8. Comparative Root-Finding Analysis ($\mathbf{x - \cos(x)}$) (NEW)

Implementation and comparative study of multiple iterative methods to find the root of the function $f(x) = x - \cos(x)$.

* **Implementation & Comparison:** The root is found using four different numerical routines:
    * **Newton-Raphson Method** (Lab 5.1)
    * **Bisection Method** (Lab 5.1)
    * **Fixed-Point Iteration** (Lab 5.1)
    * **Secant Method** (Lab 5.2 - Implemented from scratch based on the Newton-Raphson routine)
* **Convergence Study:** A single figure is plotted to compare the **convergence rate** of each method as a function of the number of iterations . This visualization is crucial for analyzing the efficiency of each algorithm (linear vs. quadratic).
